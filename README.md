# TDT4240 Pattern Exercise
- Choosing the Pong game (task 4) from the first exercise to 
## Implementing the Singleton Pattern
Since every game of Pong only includes one ball, one left paddle and one right paddle - these classes are converted to using the Singleton Pattern.
Also only one Game State Manager, so this is also implemented as Singleton
## Implementation of _at least one_ additional pattern from the list specified in the exercise
- [State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern): My code from exercise 1 used many of the same principles and techniques as Brent Aureli in his [Flappy Bird-tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzBVTPaUUDg). In this series he utilized the [State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) and hence my code from exercise 1, already had this pattern implemented. TODO: Write how this is used
- [Model-view-controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller): In addition to the state pattern, MVC is implemented in this project. TODO: Write how when finished
Maybe use the template pattern instead?
## Theory questions
a) For the patterns listing in Step3, which are architectural patterns, and which are design
patterns? What are the relationships and differences of architectural patterns and design
patterns?
TODO: Write answer
b) How is the pattern you chose realized in your code? (Which class(es) works as the
pattern you chose?)
TODO: Write answer
c) Is there any advantages in using this pattern in this program? (What are the
advantages/disadvantages?)
TODO: Write answer
